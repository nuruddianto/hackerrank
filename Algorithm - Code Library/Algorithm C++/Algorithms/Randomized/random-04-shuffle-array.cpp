Given an array, write a program to generate a random permutation of array elements. This question is also asked as “shuffle a deck of cards” or “randomize a given array”.



Let the given array be arr[]. A simple solution is to create an auxiliary array temp[] which is initially a copy of arr[]. Randomly select an element from temp[], copy the randomly selected element to arr[0] and remove the selected element from temp[]. Repeat the same process n times and keep copying elements to arr[1], arr[2], … . The time complexity of this solution will be O(n^2).

Fisher–Yates shuffle Algorithm works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is, we are given a function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.
The idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole array (including last). Now consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the process till we hit the first element.
*//

// C Program to shuffle a given array
 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
 
// A utility function to swap to integers
void swap (int *a, int *b)
{
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
 
// A utility function to print an array
void printArray (int arr[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    printf("\n");
}
 
// A function to generate a random permutation of arr[]
void randomize ( int arr[], int n )
{
    // Use a different seed value so that we don't get same
    // result each time we run this program
    srand ( time(NULL) );
 
    // Start from the last element and swap one by one. We don't
    // need to run for the first element that's why i > 0
    for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
    {
        // Pick a random index from 0 to i
        int j = rand() % (i+1);
 
        // Swap arr[i] with the element at random index
        swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
    }
}
 
// Driver program to test above function.
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/ sizeof(arr[0]);
    randomize (arr, n);
    printArray(arr, n);
 
    return 0;
